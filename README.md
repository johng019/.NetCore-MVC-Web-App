# .NetCore-MVC-Web-App
This is a .Net Core (MVC, CRUD) Web Application that allows users to access and alter records from a fictional database. 
Authorization is implemented to qualify user engagement and limit access to altering records. 

I built this application with Visual Studios 2019 IDE.
It is a standard .Net MVC web application setup and scaffolding.

The MVC portion for the UI was created from the models created.

The database integration was implemented thru Entity Framework with migrations added for all tables.
The database was adjusted in "Designer" view to modify primary key Identity specifications.

The project allows for login and account creation - thru default connections, and user/role implementation.
